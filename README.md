### About
StbSharp is C# port of the famous C framework: [https://github.com/nothings/stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)

Following libraries had been ported: stb_image.h, stb_image_write.h, stb_image_resize.h, stb_dxt.h and stb_vorbis.c.

It is important to note, that those ports arent manual. But it has been ported using project called [Sichem](https://github.com/rds1983/Sichem).

### Documentation
StbSharp has same API as STB. Therefore the STB documentation is valid for StbSharp as well.
However some wrapper classes and helper functions had been added.

The [wiki](https://github.com/rds1983/StbSharp/wiki) contains instructions about referencing StbSharp in a project and the code samples.
